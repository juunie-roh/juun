# Juun

**A self-documenting knowledge system where the development process is the content.**

This project demonstrates architectural thinking across multiple domains: technical implementation, editorial design, information architecture, and knowledge management. Every decision is documented, every experiment is tracked, and the project itself serves as both portfolio and learning laboratory.

## Purpose

This project serves multiple integrated functions:

**Knowledge System**: Development process generates documentation automatically. Building features creates timeline entries, solving problems produces blog articles, and architectural decisions become ADRs—all from the same work.

**Design Laboratory**: Exploring information architecture through progressive disclosure. Magazine-inspired index design, sequential access patterns, and visual hierarchy that mirrors cognitive load.

**Technical Playground**: Real-world implementations of monorepo patterns, serverless architecture, performance optimization, and modern frontend patterns—all measured and documented.

**Professional Demonstration**: Not showcasing what was built, but HOW decisions are made. Architectural thinking made visible through systematic documentation across 14+ decision points.
