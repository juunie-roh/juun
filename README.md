## Deployment Strategy

### Branch Structure

This repository uses a specific branch structure for deployment:

- `main`: Main development branch - all feature development and PRs should target this branch
- `vercel`: Deployment branch - **DO NOT** directly push or create PRs to this branch

### Vercel Branch

The `vercel` branch is automatically synchronized from `main` through GitHub Actions.
It's specifically configured for Vercel deployment with the proper settings for the monorepo structure.

#### ðŸ›‘ Important:

- Never create pull requests targeting the `vercel` branch
- Never push directly to the `vercel` branch
- All changes should go through `main` and will be automatically synced to `vercel`

The `vercel` branch is protected and can only be updated through the automated GitHub Actions workflow.
