### Situation

The file-based dynamic routing blog system was a prototype designed to be database-driven from the start. Running a private server just for blog articles was overkill, and the infrastructure decision had been delayed for too long.

### Task

- Integrate a serverless database without requiring a traditional backend framework
- Create a reusable, framework-agnostic database package

### Action

1. Chose Neon PostgreSQL via Vercel Integrations for serverless infrastructure delegation
2. Integrated Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
3. Created @juun/db package with no React/Next.js dependencies
4. Implemented singleton pattern to prevent connection pool exhaustion
5. Organized queries using namespace pattern (`post.get.all()`, `post.get.byId()`)

### Result

- Zero backend framework code required
- Type-safe database access from schema to UI
- Automatic scaling with scale-to-zero cost optimization
- CI/CD pipeline includes Prisma generation in postinstall
- Database package reusable across different frameworks
