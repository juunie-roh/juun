### Situation

Using Resium (React wrapper for Cesium) added 1MB to the bundle.
Only using Resium's basic Viewer component, others were redundant.
Additionally, Resium's declarative abstractions are not appropriate for dynamic scenes.

### Task

- Remove Resium dependency

### Action

#### Implemented native component

- Created custom viewer component with `forwardRef`
- Direct Cesium API usage
- Maintained React-friendly interface

### Result

Reduced bundle size by 1 MB (significant for FCP) and gained full control over Cesium APIs.
