### Situation

Micro-frontend was proposed by executives at work place.
Wanted to research micro-frontend patterns for both blog content and a production application at work.

### The Experiment

- Implemented Next.js multi-zone
- Split app into independent zones
- Tested real-world performance

### Findings

- Full page reload on route transitions (SPA → MPA regression)
- Lost client-side routing benefits
- Complexity not justified for portfolio scale
- 77% potential degradation risk identified

### Decision: Reversal

Removed multi-zone architecture after 1 day

### Professional Impact

Used this experimental evidence to challenge executive proposal
for micro-frontend at work, preventing costly architectural mistake.
