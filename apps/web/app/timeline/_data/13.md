### Situation

The original portfolio system used file-based dynamic routes (`[slug]` pattern) where each project had its `tsx` files.
Additionally, the term "portfolio" felt too formal for experimental tech demos and learning projects.
For items that can have their own layouts for each, a dynamic routing system with unified layout was not appropriate.
To disclose the purpose of this section more clearly, rebranding and reconstruction were inevitable.

### Task

Redesign the portfolio architecture to:

1. Rebrand from "portfolio" to "playground" to better reflect the experimental nature.
2. Switch to static routing system to enable various layouts for each item.
3. Provide alternative for each item's entry point. Since no longer utilizing dynamic routing system, automatic entry point generation (previously with card component) will be lost.
4. Adopt the proven architectural pattern from `cesium-utils`. (private folders, centralized config)
5. Ensure type safety and prevent runtime errors from missing data

### Action

#### 1. Conceptual Rebranding

- Renamed `/portfolio` to `/playground` across the codebase.
- Updated terminology: "portfolio items" → "playground items".

#### 2. Routing System Migration

- Removed dynamic `[slug]` routes and individual project `tsx` files.
- Created static routes under `/playground`, enabling independent layouts per item.

#### 3. Entry Point Generation

- Created `apps/web/app/playground/_data/index.ts` as single source of truth, following `cesium-utils` pattern.
- Entry points for each playground item are sourced from centralized data, displayed by `PlaygroundItem` component.

#### 4. Component Architecture

- Followed existing `cesium-utils` pattern. Private folders for feature isolation and cohesion, with centralized item configuration.
- Built reusable `PlaygroundItem` component with consistent styling.
- Removed file-based routing utilities (slug generation, file-system utility).

#### 5. Type Safety Assurance

- Defined types (`PlaygroundItem`, `PlaygroundCategory`) including `imageStyle` prop for flexible image rendering modes.

#### 6. Content Rendering

- Reused existing markdown processing infrastructure for item descriptions.
- Server-side data transformation, client-side rendering for optimal performance.

### Result

The playground section now has a clearer purpose and improved narrative.
The complexity of adding items slightly increased by adopting static routing instead of dynamic, because automatic entry point and route generation were lost.
But at the same time, by adopting the `cesium-utils` pattern with centralized configurations, the overall complexity was maintained at a similar level.
Further, it freed items from fixed layout constraints, letting them have diverse layouts aligned with their own purposes.
Now it can serve static html pages as is, without framework coordination.
